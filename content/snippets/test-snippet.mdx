React is a single-page application. It has only one single `index.html` file. Vercel doesn't redirect all routes to `index.html`. For this, you can get a 404 error. Here's how to fix it

At the root of your React project create a `vercel.json` file and add this to point all routes towards index.html.

```json filename="vercel.json"
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
}
```

After this redeploy your code to vercel and everything should work fine.
